/*This are the 4 core concepts of OOP which are : -
1) ENCAPSULATION
2) ABSTRACTION
3) INHERITANCE
4) POLYMORPHISM
Before OOP, we had procedral programming (2a) where we have different functions handling different datas/variables and as the program grows, you have bunch of functions and datas all over the place like spaggetti. (2b, 2c) OOP came to the rescue and

ENCAPSULATION : - in OOP, datas that are related to functions are grouped in UNITS.
This functions are called METHODS and this data/variables are called PROPERTY. (2d). This is known as encapsulation which is the concept of grouping variables and methods that works on them in units. (2e, 2f)
(2g) In the 2g image, we see clear difference between OOP and procedural programming. We have the procedural code ontop where the function that calculates the wage is decoupled from the variables and because of this the functions had to take many parameters.
    But below it we have the OOP solution where we encapsulate both the variables and the functions inside an object "employee{}" and because of this encapsulation, the function didnt need to take any parameter because we have modelled all the variables in the object because they are now highly related.

ABSTRACTION: - In practice, abstraction is like a dvd player that is having alot of complex logic on the inside but on the outside you only have few buttons you press to trigger the action you need without you worrying about the complex codes (2h). So in programming terms, we can hide some of the properties and methods from the outside and this gives us some benefits: Simpler interface due to fewer methods and properties, Reduce the impact of change, because those hidden codes are hidden to the outside, we can easily change them without them having any negative impact to the codes exposed outside.

INHERITANCE: - This enables you to eliminates redundant/excess codes. (2i) in the case of this image, we have 3 different html elements that needs same property and methods. Instead of creating this for each of the element, we can add this property and methods under HTMLElement and have the html elements ref this to get the property and methods needed.

POLYMORPHISM: - POLY : Many, MORP: Form... Polymorphsim is a technique in OOP for getting rid of long if...else or switch....case statements.
