/*In low level languages like C or C++, when creating an object, we need to allocate a memory to it and when we are done, we need to de-allocate the memory but in javascript we dont av this concept instead we use Garbage collector which automatically finds the const and variables that are no longer in used and then deallocate the memory that was allocated to them earlier.......So memory allocation in js happens automatically behind the scene and you have no control over that.  */
